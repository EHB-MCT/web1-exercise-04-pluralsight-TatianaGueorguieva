    <h3> Pluralsight Skills </h3>

    <h1> Where teams build better <br> technology skills, faster</h1>

    <h4> Technology teams are only as successful as their skills are relevant.
    <br> Give them access to Pluralsight Skillsâ€”courses, assessments, learning paths, and labs
    <br> and you give them the tech fluency they need to build business-critical skills.</h4>
